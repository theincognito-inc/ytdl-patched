class YoutubeDL(object):
    """YoutubeDL class.

    YoutubeDL objects are the ones responsible of downloading the
    actual video file and writing it to disk if the user has requested
    it, among some other tasks. In most cases there should be one per
    program. As, given a video URL, the downloader doesn't know how to
    extract all the needed information, task that InfoExtractors do, it
    has to pass the URL to one of them.

    For this, YoutubeDL objects have a method that allows
    InfoExtractors to be registered in a given order. When it is passed
    a URL, the YoutubeDL object handles it to the first InfoExtractor it
    finds that reports being able to handle it. The InfoExtractor extracts
    all the information about the video or videos the URL refers to, and
    YoutubeDL process the extracted information, possibly using a File
    Downloader to download the video.

    YoutubeDL objects accept a lot of parameters. In order not to saturate
    the object constructor with arguments, it receives a dictionary of
    options instead. These options are available through the params
    attribute for the InfoExtractors to use. The YoutubeDL also
    registers itself as the downloader in charge for the InfoExtractors
    that are added to it, so this is a "mutual registration".

    Available options:

    username:          Username for authentication purposes.

                       HTTP header
    geo_bypass_country:
                       Two-letter ISO 3166-2 country code that will be used for
                       explicit geographic restriction bypassing via faking
                       X-Forwarded-For HTTP header
    geo_bypass_ip_block:
                       IP range in CIDR notation that will be used similarly to
                       geo_bypass_country
    escape_long_names: If True, it splits filename into 255-byte chunks in current locale,
                       to avoid "File name too long" error. Most user don't need this.
    live_download_mkv: If True, live will be recorded in MKV format instead of MP4.
    printjsontypes:    DO NOT USE THIS. If True, it shows type of each elements in info_dict.
    check_peertube_instance: If True, generic extractor tests if it's PeerTube instance for
                             requested domain.
    check_mastodon_instance: Same as above, but for Mastodon.
    extractor_retries: Number of retries for known extractor errors. Defaults to 3. Can be "infinite".
    test_filename:     Use this to filter video file using external executable or regex
                        (compiled regex or string starting with "re:").
                       For external executable, return code 0 lets YTDL to start downloading.
                       For regex, download will begin if re.search matches.
    lock_exclusive:    When True, downloading will be locked exclusively to
                       this process by creating .lock file.
                       It'll be removed after download.

    The following options determine which downloader is picked:
    external_downloader: A dictionary of protocol keys and the executable of the
                       external downloader to use for it. The allowed protocols
                       are default|http|ftp|m3u8|dash|rtsp|rtmp|mms.
                       Set the value to 'native' to use the native downloader
    hls_prefer_native: Deprecated - Use external_downloader = {'m3u8': 'native'}
                       or {'m3u8': 'ffmpeg'} instead.
                       Use the native HLS downloader instead of ffmpeg/avconv
                       if True, otherwise use ffmpeg/avconv if False, otherwise
                       use downloader suggested by extractor if None.
    compat_opts:       Compatibility options. See "Differences in default behavior".
                       The following options do not work when used through the API:
                       filename, abort-on-error, multistreams, no-live-chat,
                       no-clean-infojson, no-playlist-metafiles, no-keep-subs.
                       Refer __init__.py for their implementation

    The following parameters are not used by YoutubeDL itself, they are used by
    the downloader (see yt_dlp/downloader/common.py):
    nopart, updatetime, buffersize, ratelimit, throttledratelimit, min_filesize,
    max_filesize, test, noresizebuffer, retries, continuedl, noprogress, consoletitle,
    xattr_set_filesize, external_downloader_args, hls_use_mpegts, http_chunk_size.

    The following options are used by the post processors:
    prefer_ffmpeg:     If False, use avconv instead of ffmpeg if both are available,
                       otherwise prefer ffmpeg. (avconv support is deprecated)
    ffmpeg_location:   Location of the ffmpeg/avconv binary; either the path
                       to the binary or its containing directory.
    postprocessor_args: A dictionary of postprocessor/executable keys (in lower case)
                       and a list of additional command-line arguments for the
                       postprocessor/executable. The dict can also have "PP+EXE" keys
                       which are used when the given exe is used by the given PP.
                       Use 'default' as the name for arguments to passed to all PP
                       For compatibility with youtube-dl, a single list of args
                       can also be used

    The following options are used by the extractors:
    extractor_retries: Number of times to retry for known errors
    dynamic_mpd:       Whether to process dynamic DASH manifests (default: True)
    hls_split_discontinuity: Split HLS playlists to different formats at
                       discontinuities such as ad breaks (default: False)
    extractor_args:    A dictionary of arguments to be passed to the extractors.
                       See "EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS" for details.
                       Eg: {'youtube': {'skip': ['dash', 'hls']}}
    youtube_include_dash_manifest: Deprecated - Use extractor_args instead.
                       If True (default), DASH manifests and related
                       data will be downloaded and processed by extractor.
                       You can reduce network I/O by disabling it if you don't
                       care about DASH. (only for youtube)
    youtube_include_hls_manifest: Deprecated - Use extractor_args instead.
                       If True (default), HLS manifests and related
                       data will be downloaded and processed by extractor.
                       You can reduce network I/O by disabling it if you don't
